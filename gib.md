# Gib updater package list

## Gib updater is a open-source android pacman for "deploying your things for beta testing without dumping everything to a file sharing site or the equivalent". It is completely free and run by indepedent developers who would like to host their packages and get stats on download counts, user response, etc. We intend to fully release the source code soon.

## Note: This list is just a rough gauge of the real one. We did not seek permission from fdroid and other community based projects to include their packages. However, anyone is free to request for their package to be included as long the downvotes don't spike. There will be no need to open-source the package and the package must be free(mium). Also, we condemn piracy and respect user privacy, please inform us if any package violates these aspects. It will be taken down ASAP after we review the report.

## Gib requires root access since it provides native flashing, on-the-go updates fresh from CI and permission/default app settings.

## Also, the system section packages are the recommended packages for pizzAOSP. Feel free to install them in any other rom though :3
