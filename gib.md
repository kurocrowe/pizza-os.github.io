# Gib updater package list

## Note: This list is just a rough gauge of the real one. We did not seek permission from fdroid and other community based projects to include their packages. However, anyone is free to request for their package to be included as long we review the code. There will be no need to open-source the package and the package must be free(mium).

## Gib requires root access since it provides native flashing, on-the-go updates fresh from CI and permission/default app settings

## Also, the system section packages are the recommended packages for pizzAOSP. Feel free to install them in any other rom though :3
