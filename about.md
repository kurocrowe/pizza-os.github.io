1) Preamble
PizzAOSP is a custom android rom developed by alamo18, ATechnoHazard, raphielscape, JagravNaik and rm-rfasterisk. This rom aims to be clean, optimised and unique. We thought out the typical româ€™s issues and we considered the best case scenario from the user perspective. All the tweaks are thought out carefully to attain the aims of this rom.

2) Features:
- Optimised Base
- Preinstalled nano gapps (because of stability and GAPPS IS A PAIN TO DOWNLOAD AND FLASH)
- NO Bloat (We guarantee no bloat. You have the right to choose apps that you want, in gib updater. Just think of it as a clean layer of chewy cheese on the pizza)
- OMS? (yeah every rom has this no shit lol)
- Delicious toppings (We love toppings on pizza)
- Official builds? (Every device has the right to be official. As long as the device does not have major issues, the mainatiner can just provide us with the trees of the device, and update them accordingly. Build will be done on our server xD)
- Weeklies and monthlies. (Experimental branches are private cus we don't want any dank peeps to break the update process. It will be merged every month)
- Gib updater (our literal package manager for the rom \o/)
