# 1) Preamble

PizzAOSP is a custom android rom developed by alamo18, ATechnoHazard, raphielscape, JagravNaik, and rm-rfasterisk. This rom aims to be clean, optimised and unique. We thought out the typical româ€™s issues and we considered the best case scenario from the user perspective. All the tweaks are thought out carefully to attain the aims of this rom.

## 2) Features:

- **Optimised Base:** 
    Everyone wants a fast phone without lags over time, don't they?
    
- **Preinstalled nano gapps:**
    Because of stability and GAPPS IS A PAIN TO DOWNLOAD AND FLASH
    
- **NO Bloat:**
    We guarantee no bloat, you have the right to choose apps that you want, in gib updater. Just think of it as a clean layer
    of chewy cheese on the pizza.
    
- **OMS**
    Because sometimes having a stock looking interface is terribly boring. 
    
- **Toppings:**
    Everyone loves toppings on a pizza, don't they? Toppings is out very own one stop application for all your feature
    hankerings.
    
- **Official builds:**
    Every device has the right to be official. As long as the device does not have major issues, the maintainer can just
    provide us with the trees of the device, and update them accordingly. Builds will be done on our server(s) xD
    
- **Weeklies and Monthlies:**
    Love living on the bleeding edge side of android? Out Weeklies are just for you. Or do you prefer a much more stable 
    experience? You will be recieving update once a month with security updates and bug fixes.
    
- **Gib updater:**
    A package manager we will be integrating into the rom for our homecooked applications.
    
- **Hibernate:**
    Hibernate by saving ram contents into a file/swap and reload it when hibernation gets over. Needs kernel support. This can help save     a ton of battery and wake speads are lightning fast too.
    
- **Maintainance:**
    There is no need for those weird booster apps. You can enable on-the-go fstrim and cache clearing in the maintainance app (enabled       by default, app is not installed by default, you have to install the package via gib updater). We also make sure your apps are           always zipalined. This implementation might be done via a service in the maintainance app or just a simple cron job.
